# Chapter 2 Workflow: Basics
## Coding Basics
Create new objects:
```R
x <- 3*4
[object_name] <- [name] # means "object name gets value ..."
```
### Object Name
Object names must start with a letter, and can only contain letters, numbers, underscore, and ".". (recommend using \_)

- `Command` + $\uparrow$  will list all the commands you've typed.
- In R programming language, typo matters, case matters, variable `X` and `x` are different.
### Calling Functions
For Built-in functions
```R
function_name(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, ...)
```
`option` +`shift`+`K` shows all the shortcuts of R
`fn`+`F1` shows function help
