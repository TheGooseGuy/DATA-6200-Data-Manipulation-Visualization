This course provides a hands-on introduction to the manipulation and visualization of complex data sets using a programming language. Efficient techniques for importing and exporting data in various formats, data acquisition, data integrity, and good analysis practices are discussed. Several programming tools and libraries are introduced to restructure, transform and fuse disparate data types for visualization and data summaries in table format. Basics of manipulating space-time data is also covered.
